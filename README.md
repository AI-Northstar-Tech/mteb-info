# mteb-info
Static copy of the MTEB Leaderboard on huggingface

It can be found at mteb.info (or https://ai-northstar-tech.github.io/mteb-info).

This is meant to be a way to quickly look up the MTEB benchmark for text embeddings model (since the source of truth page - https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard - is a huggingface space that loads slowly).

To make corrections and improvements to the page, please send a PR to this repository.
